### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Lukas
#### Mainly C# backend developer
I'm a C# backend developer who likes to try out many things, especially things regarding relatively low-level structures.

I've been using Linux as my main-OS for a long while, though I decided to swap back to windows due to comfortability.
