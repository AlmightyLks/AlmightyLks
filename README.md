### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Lukas
#### Mainly C# backend developer
I'm a C# backend developer who likes to try out many things, especially things regarding relatively low-level structures.

Have been using Linux as my main-distro for a long while, though I decided to swap back to windows due to comfortability.

Skills: C# / [Node] JS 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [EXILED](https://github.com/galaxy119/EXILED)-API Plugins 
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with (ethically) making game modifications
